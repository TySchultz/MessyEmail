# MessyEmail
An app to solve my messy inbox 


# Why

> Why should this exist

I have way to many emails in my inbox and I need to be able to organize them. 

There is 5000+ unread and maybe 5% are actually something I want to see. 


# What 

> What will move the needle 

An interface that would let you sort the inbox by sender. 

Go from sender to sender and be able to view all of the emails in a list. 


# How 

> How to deliver the impact
